# Solar Alice Springs

Alice Springs rental properties are [losing out](http://www.abc.net.au/news/science/2018-02-18/how-can-renters-get-solar-panels/9409098) in the push by government to develop photovoltaic (PV) power infrastructure in Alice Springs. 

[SolarAS]() has developed a webpage, Solar Homes Alice, and a set of SolarAS web-based tools to assist renters and landlords in navigating the difficult terrain of upgrading a rental house’s Solar power systems.

- The [Solar for your rental]() page outlines a process for renters considering how they might convince a landlord to take the mutually beneficial step of obtaining solar for their rental property
- The [Solar best practices]() page provides a useful set of links and standards to ensure that installers and consumers are aware of the kinds of considerations that must be made to ensure the success of a home solar power system in the Alice Springs and in rural and remote communities.
- The [Solar performance]() page contains a set of visualizations that track the current performance of Alice Spring’s public infrastructure against your own.
- The [Solar certification]() page that agents can use to leverage the enthusiasm of prospective renters for Solar power. 

If we take the current Core Logic property data for [Alice Springs](https://www.yourinvestmentpropertymag.com.au/top-suburbs/nt-0870-alice-springs.aspx), [Larapinta](https://www.yourinvestmentpropertymag.com.au/top-suburbs/nt-0870-larapinta.aspx), [The Gap](https://www.yourinvestmentpropertymag.com.au/top-suburbs/nt-0870-the-gap.aspx) and [East Side](https://www.yourinvestmentpropertymag.com.au/top-suburbs/nt-0870-east-side.aspx) as examples, Landlords must wait between 74 and 104 to have a vacated rental filled. Having an in-demand rental property can save landlords thousands of dollars in lost rental income and ensure that renters come and stay for longer in a home that they can feel more positive about living in for longer.
