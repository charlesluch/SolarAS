# REPORT: Solar in Alice Springs

## The Solar Homes Alice webpage

Alice Springs rental properties are [losing out](http://www.abc.net.au/news/science/2018-02-18/how-can-renters-get-solar-panels/9409098) in the push by government to develop photovoltaic (PV) power infrastructure in Alice Springs. 

In response, SolarAS has developed a webpage, [Solar Homes Alice](), and a set of SolarAS web-based tools to assist renters and landlords in navigating the difficult terrain of upgrading a rental house’s Solar power systems.

- The [Solar for your rental]() page outlines a process for renters considering how they might convince a landlord to take the mutually beneficial step of obtaining solar for their rental property.
- The [Solar best practices]() page provides a useful set of links and standards to ensure that installers and consumers are aware of the kinds of considerations that must be made to ensure the success of a home solar power system in the Alice Springs and in rural and remote communities.
- The [Solar performance in Alice Springs]() page contains a set of visualizations that track the current performance of Alice Spring’s public PV infrastructure, .
- The [Solar certification]() page that agents can use to leverage the enthusiasm of prospective renters for Solar power. 
- The [New developments]() page is a blog of upcomming innovations in the renewable energy space that may be particularly interesting to regional and remote councils 

[Territory Generation's 2016-17 annual report](http://territorygeneration.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/TerritoryGeneration_AnnualReport_2017_web.pdf) has recently completed a battery storage solution for 

The *purpose* of this site is to leverage existing good will towards renewables and solar in Alice Springs to help alter the system in such a way that uptake of these beneficial and more environmentally friendly technologies are universal. 

SolarAS appreciates that rental issues in Central Australia does not stop at when you get out of town.

## The investment case for Landlords

There are many advantages to the renter that must be considered when providing power to 

1. If we take the current Core Logic property data for [Alice Springs](https://www.yourinvestmentpropertymag.com.au/top-suburbs/nt-0870-alice-springs.aspx), [Larapinta](https://www.yourinvestmentpropertymag.com.au/top-suburbs/nt-0870-larapinta.aspx), [The Gap](https://www.yourinvestmentpropertymag.com.au/top-suburbs/nt-0870-the-gap.aspx) and [East Side](https://www.yourinvestmentpropertymag.com.au/top-suburbs/nt-0870-east-side.aspx) as examples, Landlords must wait between 64 and 104 to have a vacated rental filled. Having an in-demand rental property can place landlords' porperties on the bottom 50% of those averages, potentially saving landlords thousands of dollars in lost rental income. 
2. Renters will choose solar powered properties for the benefits they provide in reductions in power bills and to make a choice that positively effects the environment. 

## The efficiencies to agents

There are many potential pitfalls cited in the tennant-landlord agreement that can be prevented with good negotiating facilitated by the agent:

**1. Preventing power shut off by advocating for proactive improvements to residential solar infrastructure**

Power and Water's [FAQs about "going solar"](https://www.powerwater.com.au/sustainability_and_environment/photovoltaic_pv_solar_systems/going_solar_faqs)
lists inverter shut down as caused by high voltages in the system as one of the main problems experienced by households
